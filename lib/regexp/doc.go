    re defines regular expression functions, it's intended to be a drop-in
    subset of python's re module for starlark: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
    path: re
    functions:
      compile(pattern) Pattern
        Compile a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object, which
        can be used for matching using its match(), search() and other methods.
        params:
          pattern string
            regular expression pattern string
      findall(pattern, text, flags=0)
        Returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings.
        The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.
        If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups;
        this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group.
        Empty matches are included in the result.
        params:
          pattern string
            regular expression pattern string
          text string
            string to find within
          flags int
            integer flags to control regex behaviour. reserved for future use
      sub(pattern, repl, text, count=0, flags=0)
        Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of pattern
        in string by the replacement repl. If the pattern isnâ€™t found, string is returned unchanged.
        repl can be a string or a function; if it is a string, any backslash escapes in it are processed.
        That is, \n is converted to a single newline character, \r is converted to a carriage return, and so forth.
        params:
          pattern string
            regular expression pattern string
          repl string
            string to replace matches with
          text string
            input string to replace
          count int
            number of replacements to make, default 0 means replace all matches
          flags int
            integer flags to control regex behaviour. reserved for future use
      match(pattern, string, flags=0)
        If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern,
        return a corresponding match string tuple. Return None if the string does not match the pattern
        params:
          pattern string
            regular expression pattern string
          string string
            input string to match

    types:
      Pattern
        functions:
          match(text, flags=0)
          findall(text, flags=0)
          split(text, maxsplit=0, flags=0)
          sub(repl, text, count=0, flags=0)
